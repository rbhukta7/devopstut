Task 3.

Get me IP address of particular domain (guvi.in) 
- Attached screenshot in PR.

How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server? 
- We can use "top" to check cpu usage of a server.
- We can use "vm_stat" to check the memory consumption. Would like to add we can use commands like "kubectl top nodes/pods" to get both cpu and memory usage of the nodes/pods.

Test the connectivity between 2 nodes? I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs shows my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?
- The port is closed as the command nc -zv guvi.com 9000 output returns operation timed out. Attached ref screenshot in PR.
